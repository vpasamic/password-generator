In this project, I was tasked to create a random password generator that prompts the user for password length. 
I was able to generate a random character easily, but I spent a lot of time struggling into putting it into an array.
But, after figuring out how to push it into the array, I realized that I was going about it wrong. If I put it into an 
array, each character would be separated. As such, I needed to make the variable into a string instead of an array and use
+= to add letters into a string. After, I used dom elements to change the text box into the newly generated password.
